**Ingredients**

* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if
* 1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy
* 1/2 cup dark chocolate chip
* 3/4 teaspoons sea salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons water
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla

### bereiding

* Preheat the oven to 325Â°F.
* Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.
  In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
* In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.
* Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
* Pour the batter into the prepared pan and use a spatula to smooth the top.
* Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long).
* Cool completely before slicing. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!
